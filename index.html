<p>Elbowroom. There isn't much space to party. But a monkey can try.
Run, jump and fall towards victory in an epic race of small proportions.
Where you begin? You begin in a room, surrounded by THINGS (stay calm)! Your friend will be there, and he probably wants to race you. Amongst the clutter, you see a door. Where does this door lead you don't know, but you and your friend are getting inpatient. You approach this door. Wabaaam, zip zap swing, you are in a whole different world. You are in an Elbowroom. </p>

<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to play:</h3>

<p>You begin in the Homeroom, choose the racetrack you wish to enter by walking through its door, this will transport you into the chosen Elbowroom.
Once in an Elbowroom (race track), touch the white start line which will start the countdown to begin the race. Once the race has begun, do your best to out maneuver your opponent, dodge the traps, and avoid falling off platforms to be first to reach the back door of the Elbowroom, the end of the race!</p>
